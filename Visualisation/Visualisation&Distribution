##### Key points #####
Plots of data easily communicate information that is difficult to extract from tables of raw values.
Data visualization is a key component of exploratory data analysis (EDA), in which the properties of data are explored through visualization and summarization techniques.
Data visualization can help discover biases, systematic errors, mistakes and other unexpected problems in data before those data are incorporated into potentially flawed analysis.
This course covers the basics of data visualization and EDA in R using the ggplot2 package and motivating examples from world health, economics and infectious disease.

Key points
The most basic statistical summary of a list of objects is its distribution.
In some cases, data can be summarized by a two-number summary: the average and standard deviation. We will learn to use data visualization to determine when that is appropriate.

##### data type #####
categorical e.g. gender, region
categorical - ordinal data e.g. spice mild/midium/hot

numerical e.g. population, heights, murder rates
numerical - continous e.g. heights 68.12
numerical - discrete e.g. population size as it has to be round number

##### exercise #####
name(heights)
return name of the vector of the table heights

unique(heights$height)
return all unique value of height

length(unique(heights$height))
return the length of the dataset

table(heighs$height)
return a table of fequency for each uniqe height

Key points
A distribution is a function or description that shows the possible values of a variable and how often those values occur.
For categorical variables, the distribution describes the proportions of each category.
A frequency table is the simplest way to show a categorical distribution. Use prop.table to convert a table of counts to a frequency table. Barplots display the distribution of categorical variables and are a way to visualize the information in frequency tables.
For continuous numerical data, reporting the frequency of each unique entry is not an effective summary as many or most values are unique. Instead, a distribution function is required.
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is a function that reports the proportion of data below a value  a  for all values of  a :  F(a)=Pr(x≤a) .
The proportion of observations between any two values  a  and  b  can be computed from the CDF as  F(b)−F(a) .
A histogram divides data into non-overlapping bins of the same size and plots the counts of number of values that fall in that interval.

Code
# load the dataset
library(dslabs)
data(heights)

# make a table of category proportions
prop.table(table(heights$sex))

Creating other graphs from the video
You will learn to create barplots and histograms in a later section of this course.
